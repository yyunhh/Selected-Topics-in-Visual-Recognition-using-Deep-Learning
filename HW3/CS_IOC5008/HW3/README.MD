### Description
- Upload your submission json file in the submission folder, I will inference it and update the results on your filename for **every midnight (23:59)!**
- Try your best to get high performance (both accuracy and speed) before the deadline!
- Rank top3 on the leaderboard will be invited to make a presentation to share your methodology and get a bonus on your final score!

### Reports submission
- **Upload YOUR REPORTS to the [google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tf2M4gUE2kdETYrrjFWE0M_8MBpMMSWa)**
- Your reports (in PDF format) should include
  - GitHub/GitLab repository link
  - Reference if you use any codes from GitHub
  - **Inference benchmark **
  - Introduction
  - Methodology (Data pre-process, Model architeture, Hyperparameters,...)
  - Findings or Summary
